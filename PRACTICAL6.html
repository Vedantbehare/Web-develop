        <h3>British theoretical physicist and cosmologist</h3>
            <p>Stephen Hawking was a British theoretical physicist and cosmologist. <br>
            He was born on January 8, 1942 in Oxford, England. <br>
            Hawking was widely considered to be one of the greatest scientists of his time.<br>
             He was the first scientist to devise a cosmology that married the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, <br>
             and he made huge contributions to our understanding of black holes. </p>
